For the Pandas-Challenge, I recieved help from a tutor and used Xpert Learning Assistant.

Written Report 


Based on the data I was able to generate for the Pandas-Challenge, I noticed that there seemed to be a correlation between the school size and the Overall Passing Rate of test scores. Looking at the numbers that were generated, I beelive that there could be that smaller school size translates to smaller classroom size.
Additionally, I noticed that there was no direct correlation between the amount of money spent per student nor budget in regards to the outcome of overall test scores.
In terms of looking specifically at Charter schools, the Charter Schools outperformed District schools in regards to overall test scores. 
For this reason, Charter schools have higher average scores and a larger percentage of students passing in both subjects.


Another aspect that stood out to me regarding the data was there are schools with a size of 2000 or fewer students who have have higher average scores and also higher percentage of students passing in both subjects.
In terms of budgets costs, schools with a budget of $615 or less also have higher average scores and higher percentage passing.
